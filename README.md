# A Refrigerator Management System

## Introduction
I plan to design a refrigerator management application with expire date reminder.

***What will the application do?***

Users can add items like ingredients, food remaining and drinks 
to the refrigerator management system with a specific expire date. 
The application would order these items given the closest expiry date, 
and outline the items which have been expired. 

Moreover, user can modify the original expire date if they process 
the food ingredients. For example, there were some cucumbers that are 
supposed to expire in three day, but user decided to pickle them, therefore
the expiry date becomes "forever". Also, user can discard the items from the 
application once they junk or finish those items. 

***Who will use it?***

The target user would be people who are tired of conventional 
refrigerator experience, including but not limited to throwing 
rotted ingredients, clearing up smelling remaining, and overestimating 
the space. Basically, everyone who has a refrigerator, and want to 
have a more manageable way of using it, would be a target user of 
this application.


***Why is this project of interest to you?***

As a student with huge workloads and tight deadlines all year round. 
It has been a headache for me to maintain a healthy and manageable life-style. 
The management of items in refrigerator is one of the most annoys things 
among all housekeeping things. 

## User Stories
In the context of a refrigerator management application:
- As a user, I want to be able to add food to the fridge tracker.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove food from the fridge tracker.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of items within refrigerator in the order of approaching expire dates.
- As a user, I want to be able to discard the expired food from the fridge tracker.
- As a user, I want to be able to change the original expire date of items if I process the items (pickle, freeze, cook, etc.).

Some *functionality* I expect to realize:
- add new item 
- remove expired item
- process the item
